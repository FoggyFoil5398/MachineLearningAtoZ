# MachineLearningAtoZ

This repository holds a python notebook to help machine learning enthusiasts/data scientists understand how a typical machine learning problem is dealt with.

It includes every aspect of machine learning from EDA to predictive modeling and model evaluation.

The data since is small in size, can be downloaded from the repository itself. The data is of titanic survival report, a rather common dataset to start learning !

Feel free to ask for any queries !

Peace People !
